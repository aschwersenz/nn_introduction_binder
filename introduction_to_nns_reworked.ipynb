    "# An introduction to neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time, neural networks were like a black box for me. I knew that they could do great things, but I had no idea how they did it. So I decided to do what I often do in that case and build one on my own from the ground up. It took me a bit and quite some reading, but I succeeded, and it was like someone pulled a curtain away. I will try to distill everything I learned along the way in this notebook. It might be a bit theoretical sometimes, but at least for me, it really helped a lot to get some basic understanding of the inner functionality of neural networks. When applying neural networks, things rarely go smooth on the first try, and understanding where an error might come from and what you can do to fix it can be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not about knowing all the painful details but more about getting a feeling for neural networks, what parts they are made of, and how they play together. So don't worry if you don't understand everything or if all of this looks like total gibberish to you. If you want to, you can take this as a starting point to dive into the math behind neural nets, which can be very interesting and also satisfying once you really get it. But, again, this is absolutely not necessary. If you have a general understanding of what neural nets can do and how they do it, then I succeeded :)"

It is kind of the \"hello world\" dataset for machine learning; nearly everybody started there. It contains 60.000 images to train your neural net and 10.000 images to test afterward how good your neural net is doing. Separating your data into two sets, one for training and one for testing, is considered best practice. We split the data to later have a \"neutral\" data set to test our neural network that the network did not see before during training.

    "That's all. This may sound a bit disappointing at first. Eventually, we want to create pictures, detect dogs and cats and identify people. But actually, that is very powerful because it is a very generic data format. All we have to do is think a bit about how we can transform our desired input and output data into this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take our example of identifying handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "As input, we have a black and white image. We are only working with vectors in this example, so we have to find a way to transform the image into a vector. Representing a black and white image as numbers is relatively easy. We just represent each pixel with a number between 0 (black) and 255 (white). To transform the image now into a vector, we just take the pixel values of all columns of the picture and stack them on top of each other. A 28 x 28 image consists of 28 vectors, each containing the pixels of one column of the picture, and by stacking them up, we get a vector of the length 28 x 28 = 784. By doing so, we lose some spatial information, but our neural network can deal with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "As output, we have 10 different classes, one for each number between 0 and 9. So we could use a vector with 10 entries and set all entries to 0 except for the index of the number we are looking for, which we set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, we have transformed the input and the output for our neural net into a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    ">![](https://github.com/aschwersenz/nn_introduction/raw/master/images/vec2vec.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, neural networks can also process matrices. This makes more sense for images, as an image is by its nature already a matrix with the dimensions *pixel width* x *pixel height* x *color channels*. (e.g., 1024 x 768 x 3 for an RGB image or 1024 x 768 x 1 for a black and white picture). Then we can skip the step where we stack the column vectors. This is how images are usually processed in a neural network. Suppose you want to transform one image into another (e.g., for colorizing). In that case, you take a matrix at both ends of the neural network. But handling matrices requires a different kind of neural network, which we will not cover today, so we will stick with vectors for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes not that obvious for other data types but usually still possible with a bit of fiddling. It is possible to encode audio or video in this way. Also, text can be represented with a vector. A naive way could be to assign a number to each word and then have a vector as long as the number of words, and this way, we can input or output text into or from a neural network. But typically, we don't have to worry about that because all of this is automatically handled by prebuilt machine learning frameworks.\n"

    "\n",
    "So we have defined the input and the output, but what is actually happening in between? Somehow the neural network has to transform the vector containing an image into a vector representing the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have probably already heard somewhere, a neural network is made up of little units called neurons. A neuron takes as input a set of numbers and creates a single number as output. As you will see in a moment, a single neuron can't do much. The magic is happening as soon as multiple of them are working together. So groups of neurons are put together in something called a layer. Then several layers are stacked upon each other. The neurons in each layer are connected with neurons from the layer before and after. If the neurons from one layer are connected to all neurons from the previous and all neurons from the next layer, it is called a fully connected layer or sometimes dense layer. This is the most basic type of layer and is what we will use in this example. \n",
    "\n",
    "So a neural network performs its task through the interaction between all the neurons. One individual neuron gets the output of all the neurons from the previous layer as input, processes it somehow, and creates a single output that it then forwards to all the neurons in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    ">![](https://github.com/aschwersenz/nn_introduction/raw/master/images/nn.png)\n",

    "The first layer is called the input layer, followed by hidden layers, and the last layer is called the output layer, where you get the result. You usually have only one input and output layer and multiple hidden layers. The more layers and with that, the more neurons you have, the more complex tasks the neural network can perform - at least in general. The composition of the layers is called the architecture of a neural network. Some modern neural network architectures have more than a hundred hidden layers. This architecture is what a machine learning engineer defines. How you stack these layers together depends on the problem at hand and heavily influences how good the neural network performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the neurons in the input layer would be fed with the image's pixel values, so we need 784 neurons in the input layer. The output layer would consist of 10 neurons, one for each possible detected number.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how is an individual neuron actually processing its inputs to create an output? Obviously, this has to be the most important job in the neural network. We can think of each neuron as a little unit with a specific subtask to perform so that all the subtasks add up to the network's overall job. And how does a neuron figure out its subtask?"

    ">![](https://github.com/aschwersenz/nn_introduction/raw/master/images/twon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This weight says of how much importance the output of $n_1$ is for $n_2$ to perform its subtask. Imagine a neuron in the first hidden layer whose subtask it is to detect a diagonal stroke from the top left to the lower right in the image. The weights of the connections between that neuron and the neurons in the input layer that contain the pixels in the diagonal of the picture are probably very high. Those to all the others pixels are probably close to zero. Suppose there is now a neuron in the second hidden layer that wants to detect an X. In that case, it will have strong connections to the neurons in the previous layer that can detect diagonal strokes and disregard the output of all other neurons. This way, neurons in later layers can perform more and more complex subtasks by relying on the output from neurons in previous layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So again, the weight represents how much the output from $n_1$ can help the neuron $n_2$ to perform its subtask. The configuration of these weights enables a neural network to perform its task. This configuration is what a neural network learns. The better this configuration fits the job of the network, the better the network can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that it is often hard to imagine how this configuration arises during training. For me, it helps to imagine a neural network as kind of an organic system that has by its inner nature a tendency to organize itself in an optimal way. A bit like stones of different sizes in a jar start to sort themselves by size when you shake the jar."

This is just something called a linear combination, and in a neural network, you can't do much with only linear combinations.

Just think about how you calculate the volume of a sphere from its radius. The formula is $volume=4/3*\\Pi*r^3$ and because of that $^3$, the relationship is nonlinear. If a neural network would only consist of linear combinations without the activation function, a neural network would never be able to solve a problem as trivial as computing the volume of a sphere from its radius.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's define a couple of dimensions to make the following a bit more concrete. Let's assume we have a black and white input picture with the dimensions 28 x 28 pixels. This multiplies to 784 neurons in the input layer. Then let's say we have 32 neurons in the first hidden layer, 16 in the second hidden layer, and 10 in the output layer, one neuron for each possible digit. \n",
    "\n",
    "That means we have 32 x 784 weights between the input layer and the first hidden layer because each neuron in the first layer has access to every input neuron. This already adds up to 25.088 weights for the first hidden layer. We have 16 x 32 weights between the first and the second hidden layer and 10 x 16 weights between the second hidden and the output layer. In total, this means that we have 25.760 weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have these bias values, one for each neuron. That means 32 for the first hidden, 16 for the second hidden, and 10 for the output layer. So in total, we have 25.818 trainable parameters in our neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function in the next block creates these weights and stores them in matrices with the respective dimensions. It expects as the first parameter a list that defines the network's architecture, e.g., $[784, 32, 16, 10]$. It creates a matrix with the dimension $(32, 784)$ for the first layer and so on. We store the weights in matrices as it simplifies the calculations later on. It also creates vectors for the biases. So a vector of the length 32 for the first layer and so on. It initializes the weights and the biases to small random values. The function also expects the activation function that we want to use for the network and its first derivative but ignore that for now."

    "This is actually where a lot of the magic is happening. Training is where it's figured out what the neurons' subtasks are and how they complement each other to achieve the neural network's overall job. This algorithm is called backpropagation. Backpropagation enables us to use the errors a network is making to train it to perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we first need a way to define how good a network is actually doing. For this, we use something that is called the cost function. A cost function compares during training the network's current output with the actual true results, also called the ground truth. This is why we need training data, where each image is labeled with its true result. The problem is that a neural network never outputs the perfect answer, e.g. $(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ but something like $(0.01, 0.12. 0.15, 0.8, 0.02, 0.1, 0.04, 0.09, 0.13, 0.001)$. The cost function takes this actual output, compares it with the ground truth, and assigns a number to the difference. This number indicates how good the network is currently doing — the higher, the worse, the lower, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of variations to define a cost function, also depending on the current task. We will use a cost function where we subtract the current output of the network from the ground truth and square the result. This is not an ideal cost function, but for now, it will do.\n",

That means to change the output of the cost function, we can only change the weights and the biases. Now we have to do that in a way to minimize the cost function. How do we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of argument, let's assume for a moment we only have two weights, $weight 1$ and $weight 2$. The following picture shows a possible plot of the cost function for two weights. As you can already see, there seems to be a setting for the two weights where the cost function reaches a minimal value.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to reach the bottom of this valley in the picture above. At this point, we have the optimal configuration for both weights so that the cost function has a minimum point. This means, in turn, that the neural network performs at its best. The problem is that we don't know the shape of this function in advance. All we know is the value of the cost function for the weights' current settings by running the network with that configuration, like, for example, here $weight_1=0.8$, $weight_2=0.8$, and $cost=1.28$.\n",

    "The rest of this valley is hidden from us, and the only way we could figure it out is by trying out every possible combination of weights. This doesn't seem like a feasible solution. There are simply too many possible combinations even with only two weights, and we usually have thousands or millions of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is the trick of the backpropagation algorithm: Imagine you are a hiker in the mountains, a terrible fog appears, and you really have to find shelter at the bottom of the valley. You can't see further than one meter. What would you do? You would probably just go in a direction that is downhill. Which way is downhill is something that you can figure out even if you can't see far. And once you have reached the point where every direction around you is only uphill, you know that you have probably reached the bottom of the valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we do something very similar for the configuration of the weights. We don't know the entire shape of the function, a.k.a. the valley. Still, through some math magic, we know the derivatives of the cost function at our current point, which gives us the slope of the cost function, and with this, we know which way it's down.\n",
    "\n",
    ">![](https://github.com/aschwersenz/nn_introduction/raw/master/images/plot3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we do now in a loop. At each iteration, we check for each weight which way is down and change the value of the weight a little bit towards this direction. By doing this, we slowly walk down the shape of the function until we've reached a point where we can only go upwards.\n",

    "This process is also called gradient descent. I won't go into actually calculating all these gradients. There are a couple of links at the end of this notebook on how to derive them. Just in brief: This is why we need the derivative of the activation function and the cost function, and this is why we have to store these intermediary results for each layer."

    "\n",
    "With a couple of lines of code and without any prebuilt machine learning frameworks, we have created a neural network capable of classifying 95 out of 100 handwritten digits correctly. That is pretty impressive. Just try to think for a second of how you would have achieved something like this without a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This neural network could also be used for various other tasks, e.g., the classic dog vs. cats classification problem. We would just have to adapt the input layer to a different image size and change the output layer to only 2 neurons, one for dogs and one for cats. Still, this is probably the most basic architecture of a neural network. A lot of thinking went into creating more powerful and complex layers and architectures. You often have millions of parameters, which take weeks to train. These networks' results are often awe-inspiring, just look up the GPT-3 network for language processing or think of the self-driving cars by Tesla.\n",
